						<h3><b>Why Mobile Software Contracting is the Right Choice</b></h3>
						<p>Technology runs the world. Businesses are constantly using technology, whether that is dealing with finances, creating a user friendly website, or creating a stellar mobile application. When it comes to dealing with technology like mobile applications, in the past companies have hired a dedicated mobile developer, however times are changing and companies are realizing that they don’t need a full time mobile developer. Mobile contracting is the new way for companies to get quality mobile developing.</p>

							<div class="12u">
								<h4>No commitment involved</h4>
								<p>When working with a mobile contractor, you get to decide how much, or how little work you want done. And how much money you spend is completely up to you. This very beneficial to a company, paying a mobile contractor is a one time payment, unlike when having to pay a salary to a hired worker.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="12u">
								<h4>You'll get quick, yet good work</h4>
								<p>Since mobile contracting is freelance work, mobile contractors will do the best work they can, as fast as they can. They don’t get paid by the hour, which gives them an incentive to do good work. Mobile Contractors also want to try and get the most work in as possible, so they want to get work done quick for you.</p>
							</div>
              <div class="12u">
								<h4>Easily accessible</h4>
								<p>They run their entire businesses through the internet. Mobile Contractors want to get their names out on the internet. They are attempting to contact as many companies as possible. When trying to find a mobile contractor, you just need to put what you need on the internet, and mobile contractors will find you.</p>
							</div>
              <div class="12u">
								<h4>Mobile Contractors are specialized in what they do</h4>
								<p>When hiring a Mobile Contractor, you are positive that you are getting someone who knows what they are doing. A mobile developer, isn’t always specialized in mobile developing, often times they just have a background in technology. Mobile Contractors however are dedicated to working in the field of mobile developing, and therefore can put forth more detailed and indepth work.</p>
							</div>
              <div class="12u">
								<p>Mobile contracting is the future. And with the world revolving more around the use of cellphones, eventually all companies will be running a large portion of their business through the mobile world.</p>
